## DirectX 8 Basics


</div>

### Description

Here is an example of creating a DirectX 8 enviroment and some basic things like draving line, custom vertex, text.

I'm a beginer in DirectX tough i'm very expirienced in vb.

I was comparing dx7 and dx8.

In dx 7 i succeded to make 2d primitives as circle, line or stuff like that.

Dx8 is quite different, and this code is result of 2 day analysis of dx sdk and its help.

Anyone more expirienced should post some example on drawing basic 2d stuff as line, rectangle, circle, elipse, but if possible without usage of custom vertex type.

Any comment would be appriciated.
